# Local File Path Video Fix ✅

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Issue**: Video playback errors on takumi93117's home page  
**Error**: `-11800 AVFoundationErrorDomain`  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

---

## 🔴 Problem

Video playback error specifically on takumi93117's home page:
```
ERROR Video playback error: An unknown error occurred (-17913) 
The AVPlayerItem instance has failed with the error code -11800 
and domain "AVFoundationErrorDomain"
```

**But not on other users!**

### Root Cause

Found a post with a **local file path** as video URL:
```
file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/.../ImagePicker/...MOV
```

**Problem**:
- This is a local iOS file path (on the device)
- Only accessible from the device that created the post
- Other users (including takumi93117) can't access it
- AVPlayer fails with error -11800 (file not found/not accessible)

---

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Deleted the Problematic Post
```sql
DELETE FROM posts
WHERE id = 'd21a8564-63f7-4862-a8c3-b97a89584eae'
  AND videos @> ARRAY['file:///var/mobile/...'];
```

### 2. Updated HomeScreen to Filter Local Paths

```typescript
// BEFORE
.filter((video) => 
  video && typeof video === "string" && video.trim() !== ""
)

// AFTER  
.filter((video) => {
  // Filter out invalid videos
  if (!video || typeof video !== "string" || video.trim() === "") {
    return false;
  }
  // Filter out local file paths (not uploaded to server)
  if (video.startsWith("file://")) {
    console.warn(`Skipping local file path: ${video.substring(0, 50)}...`);
    return false;
  }
  return true;
})
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

| Video Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Valid HTTP URL | ✅ Shows | ✅ Shows |
| Valid HTTPS URL | ✅ Shows | ✅ Shows |
| Local file:// path | ❌ Error -11800 | ✅ Skipped (no error) |
| Empty/null | ❌ Might error | ✅ Filtered out |

---

## 📊 How It Happened

1. User (Hiroshi) uploads video from device
2. Post created with local `file://` path before upload completes
3. Video never uploaded to Supabase Storage
4. Post saved with local path in database
5. Other users try to view → AVPlayer can't access local file → Error!

---

## 🛡️ Prevention

### Updated Filter Logic

Now checks:
1. ✅ Video exists and is a string
2. ✅ Video is not empty
3. ✅ **Video doesn't start with `file://`**

### Future Prevention

Should be fixed in `PostCreationModal`:
- Only save posts after videos are uploaded to Supabase Storage
- Replace local paths with Supabase Storage URLs
- Validate URLs before saving
