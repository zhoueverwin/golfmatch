# Fix: "No Authenticated User Found" Issue

## üî¥ Problem Summary

**User ID**: `9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500`  
**Issue**: App shows "no authenticated user found" and empty pages  
**Root Cause**: User exists in Supabase Auth but has NO profile in `profiles` table

---

## üîç Diagnosis Results

```
‚ùå User NOT found in profiles table
‚ö†Ô∏è  This means profile was never created when user signed up
```

**What this means**:
- The user CAN authenticate with Supabase Auth
- But the app can't find their profile data
- All screens appear empty because there's no profile record

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Run SQL to Check and Create Profile

**Where to run**: Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor

**URL**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rriwpoqhbgvprbhomckk/sql/new

**SQL to run**: Copy and paste contents of `check_and_fix_user.sql`

**What it does**:
1. Checks if user exists in `auth.users`
2. Checks if profile exists in `profiles`
3. Creates profile if missing
4. Verifies creation was successful

### Step 2: Apply the Automatic Profile Creation Fix

**This prevents the issue for future users!**

Run the contents of `fix_auth_issues.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.

**What it does**:
- Creates a trigger that automatically creates profiles for new users
- Creates profiles for ALL existing users who don't have one
- Sets up proper RLS policies

### Step 3: Sign Out and Sign In Again

**In the app**:
1. If you're "logged in" but seeing empty pages ‚Üí Sign Out
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Sign Out
3. Return to Auth screen
4. Sign in with your credentials:
   - Email: Your email address
   - Password: Your password
5. ‚úÖ You should now see data (not empty!)

## üîß Alternative: Manual Profile Creation

If the automatic SQL doesn't work, create the profile manually:

```sql
-- Replace with actual email if known
INSERT INTO public.profiles (
  id,
  name,
  email,
  created_at,
  updated_at
)
VALUES (
  '9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500',
  'User Name',  -- Change this
  'user@email.com',  -- Change this to actual email
  NOW(),
  NOW()
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  updated_at = NOW();
```

---

## üîç How to Find Your Email

If you don't know the email for this user ID:

```sql
SELECT id, email, created_at
FROM auth.users
WHERE id = '9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500';
```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Fix Commands

### Option A: If you have the user's email

```sql
-- Get user info from auth
SELECT u.id, u.email, u.email_confirmed_at
FROM auth.users u
WHERE u.id = '9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500';

-- Create profile
INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, name, email, created_at, updated_at)
SELECT 
  id,
  SPLIT_PART(email, '@', 1) as name,
  email,
  NOW(),
  NOW()
FROM auth.users
WHERE id = '9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500'
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Verify
SELECT * FROM public.profiles 
WHERE id = '9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500';
```

### Option B: Find by email pattern

If you used `zhou.wenbin.x2@gmail.com` or similar:

```sql
-- Find user by email
SELECT id, email, email_confirmed_at 
FROM auth.users
WHERE email LIKE '%zhou.wenbin%'
   OR email LIKE '%x2@gmail%';

-- Check if those users have profiles
SELECT 
  u.id,
  u.email,
  CASE WHEN p.id IS NOT NULL THEN '‚úÖ Has Profile' ELSE '‚ùå No Profile' END as profile_status
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON u.id = p.id
WHERE u.email LIKE '%zhou%';
```

## üéØ Expected Result After Fix

### Before Fix:
```
‚ùå Sign in successful
‚ùå "No authenticated user found" error
‚ùå Empty pages (no data showing)
‚ùå App redirects back to login
```

### After Fix:
```
‚úÖ Sign in successful  
‚úÖ Profile loaded
‚úÖ Pages show data
‚úÖ App stays on main screen
‚úÖ Can see and edit profile
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing empty pages after running SQL

**Check if profile was actually created**:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.profiles 
WHERE id = '9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500';
```

Expected: `1`  
If `0`: Profile creation failed, check RLS policies

**Check RLS policies**:

```sql
-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename = 'profiles';

-- Should show: rowsecurity = true

-- Check policies
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename = 'profiles';
```

### Issue: User can't sign in

**Check if email is confirmed**:

```sql
SELECT email, email_confirmed_at 
FROM auth.users
WHERE id = '9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500';
```

If `email_confirmed_at` is `NULL`:
- Option 1: Manually confirm:
  ```sql
  UPDATE auth.users
  SET email_confirmed_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = '9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500';
  ```
- Option 2: Disable email confirmation in Supabase Dashboard

### Issue: Profile exists but app still shows empty

**Clear app cache**:
1. Close the app completely
2. Clear Metro bundler cache:
   ```bash
   npm start -- --clear
   ```
3. Reopen the app
4. Sign out and sign in again

**Check AsyncStorage**:
The session might be cached incorrectly. Force sign out:
1. Go to Settings
2. Click Sign Out
3. Sign in again with credentials

## üìä Verification Checklist

After applying fixes:

- [ ] Run `check_and_fix_user.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Verify profile exists (should return 1 row)
- [ ] Run `fix_auth_issues.sql` for automatic profile creation
- [ ] Sign out from the app
- [ ] Sign in again with email + password
- [ ] Check if main screen shows data
- [ ] Check if profile screen is not empty
- [ ] Try navigating to different screens

---

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it's fixed when:
1. ‚úÖ No "no authenticated user found" errors in console
2. ‚úÖ Home screen shows posts
3. ‚úÖ MyPage screen shows your profile
4. ‚úÖ Search screen shows other users
5. ‚úÖ Can edit your profile

---

## üìû If Still Not Working

1. **Export current user data**:
   ```sql
   -- Get all info about this user
   SELECT 
     u.id as auth_id,
     u.email,
     u.email_confirmed_at,
     u.created_at as auth_created,
     p.id as profile_id,
     p.name,
     p.email as profile_email
   FROM auth.users u
   LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON u.id = p.id
   WHERE u.id = '9fd46653-2d38-43b0-acfd-01511c1eb500';
   ```

2. **Check app logs**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Watch for errors in console
   ```

3. **Check Supabase logs**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Logs & Analytics
   - Look for authentication errors

4. **Last resort - Recreate user**:
   - Delete current user
   - Sign up again (will trigger automatic profile creation)
   - Test with new account

## üìù Summary

**Root Cause**: Profile missing in `profiles` table

**Prevention**: `fix_auth_issues.sql` creates profiles automatically for all new users  

**Files to run**:
1. ‚úÖ `check_and_fix_user.sql` - Fixes this specific user
2. ‚úÖ `fix_auth_issues.sql` - Prevents issue for all future users
