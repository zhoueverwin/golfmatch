# Email Verification Issue - Diagnosis & Fix

## üîç Problem
Emails are not being sent during signup verification step. This was working before.

## ‚úÖ What I Verified

### 1. Code Analysis
- ‚úÖ `signUpWithEmail()` correctly calls `supabase.auth.signUp()`
- ‚úÖ Handles email confirmation flow correctly
- ‚úÖ Shows verification screen when email confirmation is required

### 2. Database Check
- ‚úÖ Recent users show `confirmation_sent_at` timestamps (emails were sent before)
- ‚úÖ Most recent: Oct 31, 02:08:56 - confirmation sent successfully

### 3. Auth Logs
- ‚úÖ `/signup` endpoint returns 200 (success)
- ‚úÖ `/resend` endpoint returns 200 (success)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è But no email sending events visible in logs

## üéØ Root Cause
The issue is likely in **Supabase Dashboard Settings**, not in the code.

## üîß Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Email Confirmations Setting
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rriwpoqhbgvprbhomckk/auth/providers
2. Click on **"Email"** tab
3. Verify **"Enable email confirmations"** is **ON** ‚úÖ
4. If OFF, toggle it ON and save

### Step 2: Check SMTP Configuration
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rriwpoqhbgvprbhomckk/settings/auth
2. Scroll to **"SMTP Settings"**
3. Verify SMTP is configured:
   - If using Supabase built-in mailer: Should show "Built-in Mailer" (60 emails/hour limit)
   - If using custom SMTP: Verify credentials are correct

### Step 3: Check Email Template
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rriwpoqhbgvprbhomckk/auth/templates
2. Click **"Confirm signup"** template
3. Verify it includes: `{{ .Token }}` (the OTP code)
4. Template should look like:
   ```html
   <h2>Confirm your signup</h2>
   <p>Enter this code in the app:</p>
   <p><strong>{{ .Token }}</strong></p>
   ```

### Step 4: Check Rate Limits
1. Built-in mailer has **60 emails/hour limit**
2. If exceeded, emails won't send until limit resets
3. Check: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rriwpoqhbgvprbhomckk/logs/edge-logs
   - Look for email sending errors

### Step 5: Test with New Email
Try signing up with a **completely new email** (not used before):
- This ensures it's not an "existing user" issue
- If new email works, the issue might be with existing user handling

## üêõ Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Email Confirmations Disabled
**Symptom**: Users can sign in immediately without verification
**Fix**: Enable "Confirm email" in Auth ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Email

### Issue 2: SMTP Not Configured
**Symptom**: No emails sent, no errors in logs
**Fix**: Configure SMTP or use built-in mailer

### Issue 3: Rate Limit Exceeded
**Symptom**: Emails worked before, stopped working after many signups
**Fix**: Wait for rate limit reset, or configure custom SMTP

### Issue 4: Email Template Missing Token
**Symptom**: Emails sent but no OTP code in email
**Fix**: Add `{{ .Token }}` to email template

### Issue 5: Existing User Signup
**Symptom**: Trying to signup with existing email, no email sent
**Fix**: This is expected behavior - existing users won't get new confirmation emails

## ‚úÖ Quick Test
1. Sign up with a **new email address** (never used before)
2. Check if verification screen appears
3. Check email inbox (and spam folder)
4. If email arrives ‚Üí Issue is resolved ‚úÖ
5. If email doesn't arrive ‚Üí Check Supabase settings above

## üìù Code Fix (If Needed)
If Supabase settings are correct but emails still don't send, we can add explicit options:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email,
  password,
  options: {
    emailRedirectTo: 'golfmatch://auth/callback', // Optional
    data: {
      name: email.split('@')[0],
    }
  }
});
```

But this shouldn't be necessary if settings are correct.
