## Why
The GolfMatch app needs a comprehensive specification document to clearly define its architecture, features, and technical implementation for current and future development work.

## What Changes
- Creating a complete specification for the GolfMatch application
- Documenting the tech stack, architecture, data models, and core features
- Establishing clear requirements for all major components

## Impact
- Affected specs: This will create a new baseline specification for the entire application
- Affected code: No direct code changes, but this spec will guide future development
